    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk through the steps to make a distributable python package, host the package on github, distribute the package on PyPi, the Python Package Index, write documentation for your package, and host the docs on readthedocs. The instructions are for Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up accounts\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this tutorial you will need to set up (free) accounts for Github, PyPi, and ReadTheDocs linked to a common email address if you don't already have these accounts set up. You can find instructions at the links below:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Github: <https://github.com/join>\n",
    "+ ReadTheDocs: <https://readthedocs.org/accounts/signup/>\n",
    "+ PyPi: <https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markup languages\n",
    "\n",
    "reStructuredText and Markdown are lightweight markup languages (as opposed to heavyweight markup like html css combo) used for documentation among other things. This tutorial is written in Markdown. The docs for the toy python package used for demonstration are written in rSt.\n",

    "## Python Version Compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "The world of python users is currently split between python2 and python3, which have some compatibility issues.\n",
    "If you want your code accessible to the greatest number of people you should try to write python code that is\n",
    "backwards/forwards compatible. Here is a link to some tools to help with the compatibility issue.\n",

    "<http://python-future.org/automatic_conversion.html>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pip and Virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Pip is the tool that is used by PyPi to distribute python software. Sometimes it is good to install new python software in a virtual environment to make sure that it doesn't conflict with the core distribution of your OS.\n",
    "To install:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-virtualenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Git\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to need git installed on your machine. git is version control software used by github which acts as a central repository for your software. You can learn more about git here <https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/>. To install git: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get update\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get install git\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "## helloMyName\n",
    "\n",
    "I made a toy software package which is just complicated enough to explain the basics of package distribution,\n",
    "but simple enough to still be able to understand what is going on. You should clone this package from github.\n",
    "From the command line, in the directory where you want the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git clone https://github.com/aarontuor/helloMyName.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I made this package following the minimal structure tutorial found here <http://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minimal.html>\n",
    "\n",
    "A python **module** is simply a .py file with reusable python functions and classes.\n",
    "A python **package** is folder that contains a collection of python modules and packages that has a special __init__.py file at the top level. This file can simply be blank which is considered good practice, but can also be used to share code between the package's subpackages and modules. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an in depth explanation of python packages and modules see here <http://www.learnpython.org/en/Modules_and_Packages>\n",
    "\n",
    "I've already set up helloMyName on github, pypi, and readthedocs. \n",
    "Let's set up a virtual environment to install helloMyName and run it's limited utility in a python terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mkdir ~/pythonDist\n",
    "$ virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/pythonDist\n",
    "$ source ~/pythonDist/bin/activate\n",
    "$ pip install helloMyName\n",
    "$ python\n",
    "> from helloMyName import welcome\n",

    "hello world! I am depressed to be a program.\n",
    "I am veeeeery depressed excited to meet you\n",
    "8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't do much but it is freely distributed software!\n",
    "\n",
    "## hello<YourName>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's use the code you have cloned to make your own distribution!\n",
    "First let's get rid of everything that was specific to my distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First let's change the helloMyName folders by replacing 'MyName' with your name or whatever you like.\n",
    "2. Now in the top level hello<YourName> folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    $ rm -rf docs\n",
    "    $ rm -rf dist\n",
    "    $ rm -rf helloMyname.egg-info\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "helloMyName has the following structure:\n",

    "        __init__.py\n",
    "        welcome.py\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our package contains one package and one module. \n",
    "\n",
    "First let's change the helloMyName folders by replacing 'MyName' with your name or whatever you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at the contents of setup.py, the code that is used to install your program. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "We will automatically generate most of our documentation from python doc-strings using Sphinx, the python documentation generator. So we need to install Sphinx. I recommend a virtual environment for installing Sphinx but it\n",
    "isn't strictly necessary. \n",
